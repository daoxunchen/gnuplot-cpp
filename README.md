C++ interface to Gnuplot via POSIX pipes

This is a small peice of code which is based on the C interface to gnuplot written by N. Devillard. The original code was pure C and though it compiled with a C++ compiler I felt that it could be rewritten in an OO fashion. Hence this project. Like the original interface, it depends on the system having POSIX pipes.

You can download the source code using the link on the right. Included with the source code is a great example file showing some of the available features. There is some doxygen-based documentation, but it needs some work to be complete.

If you would like to help out with this project, we welcome you. Start by checking out the source code with subversion and contact the project maintainer, Jeremy Conlin jeremit0@gmail.com.
